# Retro Snake
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Abstract
Retro Snake is based on the game 'Snake' which came presintalled on every Nokia model 6110 in 1998. It features a starting menu, 
the main game which can be paused at any time and a game over screen. The goal is to collect as many 'black squares' as possible without 
colliding with the black border or your own body while the movement of the snake is tile based. 
#### Description:
The project is composed of five files: game.py, game_world.py, scoreboard.py, snake.py and fruit.py.
